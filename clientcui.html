<h1>The Client View of the Context-User-Item Model</h1>

<h2>The Session Object</h2>

<p>When a client first establishes a connection to a Context Server, there is
one server object in scope that it can send messages to.  This is the Session
object, which represents the session connection itself.  The Session object is
always known by the ref <code>"session"</code>.

<h4>The client may send the following messages to the server presence of the
Session object:</h4>

<h3>entercontext</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"session", op:"entercontext",
      context:<i>CTXREF_STR</i>,
      user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>,
      name:<i>?STR</i>,
      sess:<i>?STR</i>,
      auth:<i>?STR</i>,
      debug:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message places (or attempts to place) a user into a particular context
on the server.

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context into which the user is
seeking entry.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the ref of the user as whom the client is attempting
to enter.  Whether this parameter is required or not depends on the
context.</li>

<li><code>name</code> is a name string to present for the user in the
application user interface, particularly to other users.  This parameter is
usually only applicable when the <code>user</code> parameter is omitted.  If
both <code>user</code> and <code>name</code> are omitted, the default name is
<code>"&lt;anonymous&gt;"</code>.</li>

<li><code>sess</code> is an optional client-in-context session identifier
string, enabling the client to associate a particular context entry
notification with a particular <code>entercontext</code> request.  If this
parameter is given in the <code>entercontext</code> request, a corresponding
<code>sess</code> parameter will be provided in the <code>make</code> message
that the server sends to the client to create the client presence of the
context object.</li>

<li><code>auth</code> is an authorization string that may be required to gain
entry into the context.  If the context is a password-protected context, this
string must be the correct password.  If the context is a
reservation-controlled context, this string must be the reservation token that
was issued by the Director.</li>

<li><code>debug</code> is an optional flag that configures the session for
debugging if the server is configured to permit this.  The main effect of this
is to increase some of the timeouts when communicating over HTTP, so that a
developer who is composing requests manually using something like Telnet won't
be disconnected because they type too slowly.</li>
</ul>

If entry is successful, the server will transmit a series of
<code>"make"</code> messages describing the context and the users and items it
contains, including a description of the entering user.  This series of
<code>"make"</code> messages will be terminated by a <code>"ready"</code>
message targeted at the context, after which the client may consider itself to
be fully entered into the context.  In particular, after that point, the server
may send additional, unsolicited messages to the client describing changes in
the context environment and activity going on there.  The nature of these
messages depends on the specific application that the context is presenting.

<p>Note that a user may be entered into more than one context concurrently.
The user's presence in any particular context will be identified by a unique
context-specific reference string that will be provided as part of the user
description sent to the client in response to the <code>"entercontext"</code>
message.  Messages sent from the server to the client will use this reference
string as the message target for messages to the user, allowing the client to
disambiguate which presence (and thus which application) the message pertains
to.

<h3>disconnect</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"session", op:"disconnect" }
</code></div>

<p>This message removes the user from any contexts they are in and terminates
the session.  The connection to the server is broken.

<h3>ping</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"session", op:"ping", tag:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message tests connectivity to the server.

<ul>
<li><code>tag</code> is an optional string that may be anything of the client's
choosing.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the message is successfully received by the server, it will reply
with:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"session", op:"pong", tag:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>
<ul>
<li><code>tag</code> echoes the tag from the <code>ping</code> message, if
there was one, or will be omitted if the original <code>ping</code> also
omitted it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>debug</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"session", op:"debug", msg:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message delivers debugging information to the server.  If the server is
configured to permit this, the string given in the <code>msg</code> parameter
will be written to the server's log.  If the server is not configured to permit
this, this message will simply be ignored.

<h4>The server may send the following messages to the client presence of the
Session object:</h4>

<h3>make</h3>

<p>The server will send <code>"make"</code> messages to the session to direct
it to create client presences of context objects (within a context, successive
<code>"make"</code> messages will be directed to the context object itself to
generate the in-context user object and the other objects contained by the
context).  The <code>"make"</code> message is generic.  It is described <a
href="#msgmake">below</a>.

<h3>exit</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"session", op:"exit",
      why:<i>?STR</i>,
      whycode:<i>STR</i>,
      reload:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message informs the client that it is being disconnected from the
server.  After this message is sent, the server will close the connection.
This may be sent in reply to a <code>"disconnect"</code> message sent by the
client to the server, but it may also be sent spontaneously as a result of
events happening on the server.

<ul>
<li><code>why</code> is an optional debug string that describes the reason for
the disconnection.</li>

<li><code>whycode</code> is a machine-readable tag string that indicates the
reason for the disconnection.</li>

<p>The possible values for <code>whycode</code> and what they mean:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><code>"shutdown"</code></td>
<td>server is shutting down</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"dupentry"</code></td>
<td>you were already here</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"full"</code></td>
<td>context is full</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"nores"</code></td>
<td>you needed a reservation and didn't provide one</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"badres"</code></td>
<td>your reservation was expired or no good</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"baduser"</code></td>
<td>invalid user ref, invalid or missing user record, or unable to determine user from <code>uparam</code> parameters</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"badcontext"</code></td>
<td>invalid context ref, or invalid or missing context record</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"timeout"</code></td>
<td>you took too long before sending <code>entercontext</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"nodir"</code></td>
<td>no director available (for push)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"admin"</code></td>
<td>administrative eviction</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"dirdeny"</code></td>
<td>director denied reservation (for push)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"dirfail"</code></td>
<td>director failed (for push)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"contextclose"</code></td>
<td>context is shutting down</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"restricted"</code></td>
<td>entry to context is restricted</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"noanonymity"</code></td>
<td>context does not allow anonymous users</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"gateclosed"</code></td>
<td>context is closed to entry for application-specific reasons</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"bye"</code></td>
<td>you exited normally on purpose</td></tr>
</table><p>

<li><code>reload</code> is an optional flag (if omitted, defaults to false)
that, if true, directs the client to immediately attempt another entry to the
same context.  If the context was entered by obtaining a reservation from a
Director, the client should first obtain a new reservation.</li>
</ul>


<a name="msgsgeneric"></a><h2>Generic messages</h2>

<p>The server may send the following messages to any C-U-I object:

<h3>make</h3><a name="msgmake"></a>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:<i>CONTAINERREF_STR</i>, op:"make",
      maker:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>,
      obj:<i>OBJDESC</i>,
      you:<i>?BOOL</i>,
      sess:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message directs the client to create a client presence of a C-U-I
object.  The target of the message is the container into which the object
should be created.  If this container is <code>"session"</code>, then the new
object will be "contained" by the session; as a rule, the only objects that
will be belong to the session in this way are the contexts themselves.  Users
will be contained by context objects, while items may be contained by contexts,
by users, or by other items.

<ul>
<li><code>maker</code> is an optional indicator of the user who is triggering
the creation of the object.  Normally, this parameter will be omitted, in which
case the object is presumed to be created by the system itself.  However, this
parameter may appear if an object (normally an item) is being created as the
consequence of a particular user's actions in the context.</li>

<li><code>obj</code> is a JSON literal describing the object to be created.
These are documented in more detail <a href="#objdescs">below</a>.</li>

<li><code>you</code> is an optional flag that, if true (defaults to false if
omitted), indicates that the object being created represents the user of the
client receiving the message.

<li><code>sess</code> is an optional client-in-context session identifier
string.  This parameter will only be present when a context object is being
created, and then only if there was a <code>sess</code> parameter provided in
the <code>entercontext</code> message that led to this context creation event.
The value will echo the value from the <code>entercontext</code> message,
enabling the client to match the <code>make</code> message with its original
<code>entercontext</code> request.

</ul>

<h3>delete</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:<i>REF_STR</i>, op:"delete" }
</code></div>

<p>This message directs the client to delete its client presence of the C-U-I
object that is the target of the message, as well as any other objects it may
contain.  After this message is received, the targeted object no longer exists
in the context environment, and messages sent to the server presence of the
object will be rejected by the server.

<h3>say</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:<i>REF_STR</i>, op:"say",
      from:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>, 
      text:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message is used to carry system messages and text chat.  It directs the
client to display the text string that was transmitted, in a manner consistent
with the application in the context.  The target of this message is always the
context or a user, never an item.  If targeted at a user, the communication is
for that user.  If targeted at the context, it is for all users in the context.
(Note that a given client will only receive messages targeted at its own user
or at the context.)

<ul>
<li><code>from</code>, if given, is the ref of (another) user who is
represented by the server as the source of the message.  If omitted, the
message is considered to come from the server itself.</li>

<li><code>text</code> is the message being spoken.</li>
</ul>

<h3>push</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:<i>REF_STR</i>, op:"push",
      from:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>,
      url:<i>STR</i>,
      frame:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message directs the client to load a web page.  The target of this
message is always the context or a user, never an item.  If targeted at a user,
the intent is that that user is being pushed to the given URL.  If targeted at
the context, all users in the context are being pushed.  (Note that a given
client will only receive messages targeted at its own user or at the context.)

<ul>
<li><code>from</code>, if given, is the ref of (another) user who is
represented by the server as the source of the push.  If omitted, it is
considered to come from the server itself.</li>

<li><code>url</code> is the URL to load.</li>

<li><code>frame</code>, if given, names the browser HTML frame into which the
URL is to be loaded.  If omitted, the URL should be loaded as an entirely new
page.</li>
</ul>

<a name="objdescs"></a><h2>The Context Object</h2>

<p>When a context is created by a <code>"make"</code> message, the
<code>obj</code> parameter of the <code>"make"</code> message will be a context
descriptor, which is a JSON object of the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
    { type:"context", id:<i>CTXREF_STR</i>,
      name:<i>STR</i>,
      mods:[<i>MODDESC</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code> is the reference string for the new context.</li>

<li><code>name</code> is the context's printable name, which may be significant
in the application user interface.</li>

<li><code>mods</code>, if present, is an array of mods attached to the context.
Each of these is a JSON object describing a particular mod.  The form of these
mod descriptors varies depending on what kind of mods they are.  The current
set of supported mods is described <a href="clientmods.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon successful entry to a context (such as when the client sends an
<code>entercontext</code> message to the server presence of the session
object), the server will send a <code>"make"</code> message to the client
presence of the session object, creating the client presence of the context
itself.  This context object will then be sent one or more <code>"make"</code>
messages creating client presences for the other users in the context and for
any items contained by the context.  If any of these users or items have any
contents of their own, additional <code>"make"</code> messages will be sent to
those objects that create <i>their</i> content objects.  The end of this series
of <code>"make"</code> messages will be indicated by the server sending a
<code>"ready"</code> message to the context.  Finally, the server will send the
context a <code>"make"</code> message creating the client presence of user who
entered.

<h3>ready</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:<i>CTXREF_STR</i>, op:"ready" }
</code></div>

<p>This message signals to the client that the series of <code>"make"</code>
messages generating the context and its contents is complete and that the
context is ready for the client to interact with it.

<h3>exit</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>CONTEXT_REF</i>, op:"exit" }
</code></div>

<p>This message removes the sending user from the context and terminates their
interaction with it.

<p>The context object may understand additional messages depending on what mods
are attached to it.

<h2>The User Object</h2>

<p>When a user is created by a <code>"make"</code> message, the
<code>obj</code> parameter of the <code>"make"</code> message will be a user
descriptor, which is a JSON object of the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
    { type:"user", id:<i>USERREF_STR</i>,
      name:<i>STR</i>,
      mods:[<i>MODDESC</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code> is the reference string for the new user.</li>

<li><code>name</code> is the user's printable name.</li>

<li><code>mods</code>, if present, is an array of mods attached to the user.
Each of these is a JSON object describing a particular mod.  The form of these
mod descriptors varies depending on what kind of mods they are.  The current
set of supported mods is described <a href="clientmods.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Item Object</h2>

<p>When an item is created by a <code>"make"</code> message, the
<code>obj</code> parameter of the <code>"make"</code> message will be an item
descriptor, which is a JSON object of the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
    { type:"item",
      id:<i>ITEMREF_STR</i>,
      name:<i>STR</i>,
      mods:[<i>MODDESC</i>],
      cont:<i>?BOOL</i>,
      deletable:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code> is the reference string for the new item.</li>

<li><code>name</code> is the item's printable name.</li>

<li><code>mods</code>, if present, is an array of mods attached to the item.
Each of these is a JSON object describing a particular mod.  The form of these
mod descriptors varies depending on what kind of mods they are.  The current
set of supported mods is described <a href="clientmods.html">here</a>.</li>

<li><code>cont</code> is a flag that, if true, indicates that the item may be
used as a container (i.e., it may contain other items, even if it does not
currently do so).  If omitted, it should be treated as false.</li>

<li><code>deletable</code> is a flag that, if true, indicates that the item may
be deleted by ordinary users by sending it a <code>"delete"</code> message.  If
omitted, it should be treated as false.</li>
</ul>

<h3>delete</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>ITEMREF_STR</i>, op:"delete" }
</code></div>

<p>A client may request the server to delete a deletable item by sending a
<code>"delete"</code> message targeted at the item it wishes to delete.  If the
server complies, it will send a delete message back (see <a
href="#msgsgeneric">Generic Messages</a> above) directing the client to go
ahead and delete the item.
