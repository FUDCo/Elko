<h1>The Elko Broker Protocols</h1>

<h2>The Broker</h2>

<p>The <em>Broker</em> is an Elko server that allows a cluster of
Elko servers of various kinds to find out information about each
other's available services (and thus establish interconnectivity) without
having to be preconfigured to know about one another.  It also shields the
various servers from order of startup issues.  Finally, it provides a place to
stand for monitoring and administering an Elko server farm as a
whole.

<p>A Broker understands two different JSON message protocols.  These correspond
to the two kinds of actors who may wish to communicate with a Broker: clients
offering or seeking services, and administrators.  Each of the ports that a
Broker listens for connections on can be configured to support either or both
of these protocols.

<p>Each of these protocols is associated with a particular object ref to which
messages should be addressed:

<ul>
<li><code>client</code> for clients (which are typically themselves other kinds
of servers) seeking or providing services.</li>
<li><code>admin</code> for administrator messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Protocols</h2>

<p>While there are two different message protocols, they share a common set of
messages pertaining to connection housekeeping.  These messages may be targeted
at either of the two protocol objects described above.

<h3>auth</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"auth", auth:<i>?AUTHDESC</i>, label:<i>?STR</i>}
</code></div>

<p>This message begins a new session with the Broker, providing whatever
authorization credentials as may be appropriate (according to the Broker's
server configuration) to gain access to services.

<p>An <code>auth</code> message <strong>must</strong> be the first message sent
to <code>client</code> or <code>admin</code> on any new connection to the
Broker.  Any other message to these objects will result in immediate
termination of the connection.

<p>If the <code>auth</code> operation fails, the connection will be terminated
by the Broker.  Otherwise, the client is thereafter free to send messages
according to the protocol of the <code><i>REF</i></code> that was authorized.

<ul>
<li><code>auth</code> is a bundle of authorization information, as described
below.  The specific authorization information that is relevant depends on the
configuration of the Broker server port being connected to.  If the
<code>auth</code> parameter is omitted, an uncontrolled access in
<em>open</em> mode is assumed.</li>

<li><code>label</code> is an optional label for the connection.  This will be
used in server log entries for debugging purposes and for identifying the
connection in administrative requests.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Authorization information</h4>

<p>The <code>auth</code> parameter of the <code>auth</code> message describes
a bundle of authorization information to authorize access.  Its general form
is:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
    { type:"auth", mode:<i>STR</i>, code:<i>?STR</i>, id:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>mode</code> is the requested authorization mode.  Currently
recognized authorization modes are <code>"open"</code> and
<code>"password"</code>.  Other modes may be relevant in the future or when
talking to other kinds of servers.</li>

<li><code>code</code> is an authorization code, whose meaning varies depending
on the authorization mode.  In the case of open mode, it is irrelevant and
should not be provided.  In the case of password mode, it is a password
string.</li>

<li><code>id</code> is an optional identity string, whose meaning varies
depending on the authorization mode.  In the case of open mode, it is
irrelevant and should not be provided.  In the case of password mode, it may or
may not be relevant depending on the configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>disconnect</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"disconnect" }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the server to terminate its connection to the sender.
The connection to the server is broken.

<h3>ping</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"ping", tag:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message tests connectivity to the server.

<ul>
<li><code>tag</code> is an optional string that may be anything of the client's
choosing.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the message is successfully received by the server, it will reply
with:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"pong", tag:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>
<ul>
<li><code>tag</code> echoes the tag from the <code>ping</code> message, if
there was one, or will be omitted if the original <code>ping</code> also
omitted it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>debug</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"debug", msg:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message delivers debugging information to the server.  If the server is
configured to permit this, the string given in the <code>msg</code> parameter
will be written to the server's log.  If the server is not configured to permit
this, this message will simply be ignored.

<h2>Client Protocol</h2>

<p>The Broker client protocol is used by servers that are seeking services from
other servers, offering services to other servers, or both.

<h3>find</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"client", op:"find", service:<i>STR</i>, protocol:<i>?STR</i>,
          wait:<i>?INT</i>, monitor:<i>?BOOL</i>, tag:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message queries the Broker about the availability of some kind of
service.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>service</code> is the name of the type of service the requestor
is seeking.</li>

<li><code>protocol</code> is the name of the communications protocol by which
the requestor wishes to access the service.  This parameter is optional, and
defaults to <code>"tcp"</code> if omitted.</li>

<li><code>wait</code> is the time (in seconds) that the requestor is willing
to wait for the service to become available.  A value of 0 means that the
requestor is not willing to wait at all.  A negative value means that the
requestor is willing to wait forever.  This parameter is optional, and
defaults to 0 (don't wait) if omitted.</li>

<li><code>monitor</code> is a boolean flag indicating that the requestor
wishes to continue to be aprised of new services of the requested type as they
become known to the Broker, even after the first reply has been returned.
This parameter is optional and defaults to false if omitted.  A value of true
is invalid if the <code>wait</code> parameter was specified with a value of
0.</li>

<li><code>tag</code> is an optional tag string that, if given, will be sent
back with the response(s), to help the client match up requests and
responses.</li>
</ul>

The Broker will reply with a message of the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"client", op:"find", desc:[<i>SERVICEDESC</i>], tag:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>desc</code> is an array of service descriptors, each of which
describes one server offering the service being sought in the
original <code>find</code> request.</li>

<li><code>tag</code> echoes the tag from the <code>find</code> request, if
there was one, or will be omitted if the original <code>find</code> also
omitted it.</li>
</ul>

A service descriptor takes the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 { type:"servicedesc", service:<i>STR</i>, hostport:<i>?STR</i>,
   protocol:<i>?STR</i>, label:<i>?STR</i>, auth:<i>?AUTHDESC</i>,
   provider:<i>?INT</i>, failure:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>service</code> is the service type name of the service.</li>

<li><code>hostport</code> is a <code>"<i>hostname</i>:<i>portnumber</i>"</code>
string indicating the host and port at which the service is being
offered.  This field will be absent if the service was not available.</li>

<li><code>protocol</code> is the name of the communications protocol over which
the service is being offered.  This field will be absent if the service was
not available.</li>

<li><code>label</code> is the descriptive label given by the service provider
when it registered that the service was available.  This will be absent if the
service was not available or if the service provider did not provide a label
string (which is optional at the service provider's discretion).</li>

<li><code>auth</code> is an authorization descriptor that indicates how one
should authorize with the indicated service.  The authorization descriptor is
exactly as documented above in the description of the <code>auth</code>
request.  This field will be absent if the service was not available or if the
service provider did not share authorization information with the broker (in
the latter case, it is the responsibility of the service requestor and the
service provider to cooperate out-of-band to coordinate authorization
arrangements).</li>

<li><code>provider</code> is a simple integer provider ID associated with the
server providing the service, independent of the particular service(s) being
offered.  These provider IDs are assigned by the Broker itself.  The provider
ID enables a client to determine if multiple different services all come from
the same provider. This field will be absent if the service was not
available.</li>

<li><code>failure</code> is an error message string indicating the reason why
the Broker was unable to fulfill the request.  Typically this will be
<code>"no such service"</code>, though other errors are possible in principle.
This field will only be present in the event of failure, in which case the
other optional fields described above will be absent.</li>
</ul>

If the <code>wait</code> parameter of the original <code>find</code> request
was 0, the reply will be immediate, delivering either service information or a
"no such service" failure.  If the <code>wait</code> parameter was non-zero,
then the Broker will withhold its reply until some service provider contacts
it offering the service, or the wait period times out, or the Broker becomes
unable for some other reason to be able to offer service information.

<p>If the <code>monitor</code> parameter of the original <code>find</code>
request was true (in which case the <code>wait</code> parameter was, by
definition, non-zero), the Broker will send a new <code>find</code> response
message each time an additional service provider registers an instance of the
requested service with the Broker.  This stream of service notifications will
continue until the requested <code>wait</code> period has elapsed, or
indefinitely if the <code>wait</code> parameter was negative.

<h3>willserve</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"client", op:"willserve", services:[<i>SERVICEDESC</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>This message informs the Broker that the sender is offering to provide one
or more services.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>services</code> is an array of one or more service descriptors, each
of which describes one service that the sender is offering to provide.  The
service descriptor is as described above in the descripion of the
<code>find</code> request, except that the client should not provide a
<code>provider</code> property as this will be assigned by the Broker.  The
<code>label</code>, <code>auth</code>, and <code>protocol</code> properties
are optional at the client's discretion, but the <code>service</code> and
<code>hostport</code> properties are mandatory.</li>
</ul>

<h3>wontserve</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"client", op:"wontserve", services:[<i>STR</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>This message informs the Broker that the sender is ceasing to provide one
or more services.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>services</code> is an array of the names of one or more service types
indicating the services that the client will not be providing.  Note that it is
not an error for a client to send a <code>wontserve</code> message mentioning
services that it was not (to the Broker's knowledge) offering in the first
place.</li>
</ul>

<h3>load</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"client", op:"load", factor:<i>FLOAT</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message informs the Broker of sender's current load.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>factor</code> is the sender's current load factor.  This may be any
value, though all clients talking to a given Broker should all share a single,
commensurable metric.</li>
</ul>

<h3>reinit</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"client", op:"reinit" }
</code></div>

<p>This message is a directive from the Broker to the client, instructing the
client to reinitialize itself.  The exact meaning of "reinitialize" is specific
to the kind of client it is, but the spirit of the request is that the client
should restore itself to something resembling the condition it was in when it
first started up.  In particular, the client can obey this request by shutting
down, which terminates the connection, restarting, and restablishing its
relationship with the Broker.

<h3>shutdown</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"client", op:"shutdown", kill:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message is a directive from the Broker to the client, instructing the
client to shut itself down.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>kill</code> is an optional flag that if true orders an abrupt
termination.  Normally, the client would empty its message queues, checkpoint
any active state, and perform an orderly shutdown.  However, if the
<code>kill</code> flag is true, the client should exit immediately without
stopping to clean things up.  The value defaults to false if the parameter is
omitted.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Admin Protocol</h2>

<p>The Broker admin protocol is used to administer the Broker and, indirectly,
the entire collection of clients it is in contact with.

<h3>loaddesc</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"loaddesc", service:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the Broker to send information about the load of
registered services.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>service</code> is the optional name of a service of interest.  If
this parameter is provided, the reply will deliver load information about
providers of the named service.  If it is omitted, the reply will deliver load
information about all service providers that the Broker knows about.</li>
</ul>

The Broker will reply with a message of the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"admin", op:"loaddesc", desc:[<i>LOADDESC</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>desc</code> is an array of load descriptors, each of which
describes the load associated with one service provider.  If there are no
providers of the requested service, this array will be empty.</li>
</ul>

A load descriptor takes the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 { type:"loaddesc", label:<i>?STR</i>, load:<i>FLOAT</i>, provider:<i>INT</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>label</code> is a printable label for the service provider being
described.  This field will be absent if the service provider did not label
itself.</li>

<li><code>load</code> is the provider server's most recently reported load
factor.</li>

<li><code>provider</code> is the provider ID associated with the server
providing the service.</li>
</ul>

<h3>reinit</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"reinit", server:<i>?STR</i>,
          self:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message instructs the Broker to reinitialize zero or more of the
provider servers it knows about and, optionally, itself.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>server</code> is the optional label for a provider server to be
reinitialized.  Alternatively, the string <code>"all"</code> indicates that all
provider servers that the Broker knows about are to be reinitialized.  If
omitted, no provider servers will be reinitialized.</li>

<li><code>self</code> is an optional flag that if true directs that the
Broker itself also be reinitialized.  The value defaults to false if the
parameter is omitted.  Broker reinitialization, if requested, will take place
after any provider server reinitializations.</li>
</ul>

If any provider servers are to be reinitialized, each will be sent a
corresponding <code>reinit</code> message (see client message descriptions
above) on its client connection.

<h3>servicedesc</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"servicedesc", service:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the Broker to send information about currently
registered services.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>service</code> is the optional name of a type of service of interest.
If this is provided, the reply will deliver information about providers of the
named service.  If it is omitted, the reply will deliver information about all
service providers that the Broker knows about.</li>
</ul>

The Broker will reply with a message of the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"admin", op:"servicedesc", desc:[<i>SERVICEDESC</i>], on:BOOL }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>desc</code> is an array of service descriptors, each of which
describes one service being offered by some service provider client.  The
service descriptors are exactly as described above in the discussion of
the <code>find</code> request.</li>

<li><code>on</code> is a boolean flag indicating whether the service described
is currently being offered.  In the reply to the <code>servicedesc</code>
request, this flag will always be true, as this reply only describes services
that are actually being offered.  However, this message is also used when
watching services via the <code>watch</code> request, described below, which
will also deliver notifications about services ceasing to be offered.</li>
</ul>

<h3>shutdown</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"shutdown", server:<i>?STR</i>,
          self:<i>?BOOL</i>, kill:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message instructs the Broker to shut down zero or more of the provider
servers it knows about and, optionally itself.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>server</code> is the optional label for a provider server to be shut
down.  Alternatively, the string <code>"all"</code> indicates that all
provider servers that the Broker knows about are to be shut down.  If this
parameter is omitted, no provider servers will be shut down.</li>

<li><code>self</code> is an optional flag that if true directs that the Broker
itself also be shut down.  The value defaults to false if the parameter is
omitted.  Broker shutdown, if requested, will take place after any provider
server shutdowns.</li>

<li><code>kill</code> is an optional flag that if true orders an abrupt
termination of the indicated server(s).  Normally, servers will empty their
message queues, checkpoint any active state, and perform an orderly shutdown.
However, if the <code>kill</code> flag is true, they will exit immediately
without stopping to clean things up.  The value defaults to false if the
parameter is omitted.</li>
</ul>

If any provider servers are to be shut down, each will be sent a corresponding
<code>shutdown</code> message (see client message descriptions above) on its
client connection.

<h3>watch</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"watch", services:<i>?BOOL</i>, load:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the Broker to begin or cease providing ongoing updates
as to the status of registered client service providers.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>services</code> is an optional boolean flag indicating whether the
sender wants to be notified about services coming or going.  A value of true
indicates that the sender wishes to begin receiving such notifications.  A
value of false indicates that the sender wishes to cease receiving such
notifications.  If this parameter is omitted, the Broker's current send/don't
send setting for service notifications will be left unchanged.</li>

<li><code>load</code> is an optional boolean flag indicating whether the
sender wants to be receive load factor updates for service providers that the
Broker knows about.  A value of true indicates that the sender wishes to begin
receiving such notifications.  A value of false indicates that the sender
wishes to cease receiving such notifications.  If omitted, the Broker's
current send/don't send setting for load notifications will be left
unchanged.</li>
</ul>

If the <code>services</code> flag is true, the admin client will be sent
a <code>servicedesc</code> message each time the Broker is notified by a
service provider client about a service being offered or withdrawn.  This
message is exactly as described in the response to the
admin <code>servicedesc</code> request above.

<p>If the <code>load</code> flag is true, the admin client will be sent
a <code>loaddesc</code> message each time the Broker is notified by a service
provider client about a load change.  This message is exactly as described in
the response to the admin <code>loaddesc</code> request above.

<p>Although both the <code>services</code> and <code>load</code> parameters
are optional, in practice at least one of these parameters should be provided,
as the request is otherwise a no-op.
