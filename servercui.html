<h1>The Server View of the Context-User-Item Model</h1>

<p>The presences of C-U-I objects on the Context Server are authoritative with
respect to the shared state of those objects.  In other words, when there are
questions about the true state of reality, what the server says rules.  A
client is authoritative only with respect two kinds of things: the user
interface interpretation of those objects as presented to its own user, and the
representation of the user's intentions to the server.

<p>Furthermore, since a client in some context only communicates with the
server for that context, the client only has to worry about managing a
communications relationship with one other party.  The context's Context
Server, in contrast, communicates with all the clients in that context, hence
its model of the world is necessarily somewhat more complicated.

<p>The persistent states of C-U-I objects are maintained by the server in its
object database.  In the current implementation, these are stored as JSON
object descriptors.  When there are no users in a context, the context sits in
a quiescent state in the object database.  A quiescent context is only
activated when a user enters it.  When the context is activated, the server
loads its representation from the object database, instantiates a live context
object for it, and then manages client interaction with it.  When the last
client leaves the context, its persistent state is checkpointed back to the
object database (though certain operations in a live context can also trigger
such checkpointing during normal operation) and the context again becomes
quiescent.  Actually, it is possible, if application requirements make it
necessary, for a context to be made active absent any users within it, or to be
kept active after all users have left, but this is not the normal mode of
operation.

<p>When a context is activated, not only is the context object loaded from the
database, but so are any items that the context contains.  Furthermore, users
themselves (and the items the contain) may have persistent representations
that are also loaded upon entry.

<p>An object's descriptor in the database includes descriptors for any mods
that may be attached to that object.  Developing an application consists of
defining the context, its mods, its items, and its items' mods.  A context or
item may also define what we call <em>user mods</em>, which are temporary mods
that are attached to a user or to one of the user's items when the user enters
the context, then discarded again when the user leaves.

<p>The Context Server provides a standard library of mods that can be
recombined in different ways to produce different applications.  In addition,
it is possible to program new server-side mod classes using a standard Java
API.  As long as the mod classes are loadable from the server's configured
class path, they may be used just like any of the built in mods.  (In the
fullness of time we hope to enable server mods to be implemented in Javascript,
so that application developers can develop both the client and server portions
of their applications in a common language framework.  This will be coupled
with a modular packaging scheme enabling developers to generate a single
deployment package for an application that can be uploaded to the server and
installed.)

<p>When a server creates a new context, by convention it assigns it a ref of
the form <code>"context.<i>uniq</i>_<i>id</i>"</code>, where
<code><i>uniq</i></code> is unique token generated at server startup time, so
that multipe servers sharing a common object database can generate unique
identifiers without collisions, and <code>id</code> is a sequential integer
number that increments with each context created.  It is not required that
manually created contexts follow this convention, though it is useful for
documentary purposes to follow a similar convention by identifying contexts
with refs of the form <code>"context.<i>tag</i>"</code>, where
<code><i>tag</i></code> is a mnemonic string of some kind.  Similary, items are
given refs of the form <code>"item.<i>uniq</i>_<i>id</i>"</code> and users are
given refs of the form <code>"user.<i>uniq</i>_<i>id</i>"</code>.

<p>Clones, when they are created, are assigned refs by suffixing
<code>".<i>cloneid</i>"</code> to the base ref of the master object from which
they are cloned, where <code><i>cloneid</i></code> is a unique number issued by
the server.  Note however, that while a non-clone object's ref is a permanent
attribute of that object, clone refs are as ephemeral as the clone objects they
refer to.


<h2>The Context Object</h2>

<p>Contexts are stored in the object database indexed by their reference
strings.  A context is described by a JSON descriptor of the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
    {
</code><div class="indent"><code>
        type:"context",<br>
        name:<i>STR</i>,<br>
        capacity:<i>INT</i>,<br>
        baseCapacity:<i>?INT</i>,<br>
        semiprivate:<i>?BOOL</i>,<br>
        restricted:<i>?BOOL</i>,<br>
        mods:[<i>MODDESC</i>],<br>
        usermods:[<i>MODDESC</i>],<br>
        contents:[<i>ITEMREF_STR</i>]
</code></div><code>
    }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>name</code> is the context's printable name, which may be significant
in the application user interface.</li>

<li><code>capacity</code> is the maximum number of users permitted in the
context at any one time.  A value of -1 indicates that this is unlimited.</li>

<li><code>baseCapacity</code>, if given, establishes the capacity of the
context above which additional users attempting entry will trigger the creation
of a clone. [Note: the context cloning feature is not yet fully
implemented.]</li>

<li><code>semiprivate</code> is a flag that, if given and true, indicates that
this is what we call a semi-private context.  In a semi-private context, users
are not informed of the presence of other users and may not interact with them
directly.</li>

<li><code>restricted</code> is a flag that, if given and true, indicates that
entry to the context is access controlled.  A user attempting to enter a
restricted context may only do so if they are carrying the proper entry key.
This is explained in greater detail in the section on the ContextKey mod.</li>

<li><code>mods</code>, if present, is an array of mods attached to the context.
Each of these is a JSON object describing a particular mod.  The form of these
mod descriptors varies depending on what kind of mods they are.  The current
set of supported mods is described <a href="servermods.html">here</a>.</li>

<li><code>usermods</code>, if present, is an array of mods that should be
attached to users who enter the context.  As with the context's own mods, the
form of these varies depending on mod type.  See the mod documentation for
details.</li>

<li><code>contents</code>, if present, is an array of item refs.  When the
context is loaded from the object database, these items will also be loaded and
inserted into the context's contents collection.</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Item Object</h2>

<p>Items are stored in the object database indexed by their reference strings.
An item is described by a JSON descriptor of the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
    {
</code><div class="indent"><code>
        type:"item",<br>
        name:<i>STR</i>,<br>
        mods:[<i>MODDESC</i>],<br>
        contents:[<i>ITEMREF_STR</i>],<br>
        cont:<i>?BOOL</i>,<br>
        deletable:<i>?BOOL</i>
</code></div><code>
    }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>name</code> is the item's printable name.</li>

<li><code>mods</code>, if present, is an array of mods attached to the item.
Each of these is a JSON object describing a particular mod.  The form of these
mod descriptors varies depending on what kind of mods they are.  The current
set of supported mods is described <a href="servermods.html">here</a>.</li>

<li><code>contents</code>, if present, is an array of item refs.  When the item
is loaded from the object database, these items will also be loaded and
inserted into the item's contents collection.</li>

<li><code>cont</code> is a flag that, if present and true, indicates that the
item may be used as a container (i.e., it may contain other items, even if it
does not currently do so).</li>

<li><code>deletable</code> is a flag that, if present and true, indicates that
the item may be deleted by ordinary users by sending it a <code>"delete"</code>
message.</li>
</ul>


<h2>The User Object</h2>

<p>Users are stored in the object database indexed by their reference strings.
An user is described by a JSON descriptor of the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
    {
</code><div class="indent"><code>
        type:"user",<br>
        name:<i>STR</i>,<br>
        mods:[<i>MODDESC</i>],<br>
        contents:[<i>ITEMREF_STR</i>]
</code></div><code>
    }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>name</code> is the user's printable name.</li>

<li><code>mods</code>, if present, is an array of mods attached to the user.
Each of these is a JSON object describing a particular mod.  The form of these
mod descriptors varies depending on what kind of mods they are.  The current
set of supported mods is described <a href="servermods.html">here</a>.</li>

<li><code>contents</code>, if present, is an array of item refs.  When the user
is loaded from the object database, these items will also be loaded and
inserted into the user's contents collection.</li>
</ul>
