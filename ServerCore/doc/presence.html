<h1>The Elko Presence Server Protocols</h1>

<h2>The Presence Server</h2>

<p>The <em>Presence Server</em> is an Elko server that keeps
track of the context presence (and, optionally, the physical position) of users
connected to the various Context Servers.  Context Servers may subscribe on
their users' behalf to be notified about changes in other users' status, with
these notifications being distributed according to interests derived from the
subscribing users' social graphs.  The Presence Server in turn gets social
graph information via an external interface that allows applications to provide
their own abstractions for social graph connectivity.

<p>The Presence Server can also act as a relay point for propagating messages
to users according to application-defined criteria, such as external
identifiers, physical position, or social graph connectivity.  These messages
may originate from within the complex of Context Servers or from external event
feeds.

<p>A Presence Server understands two different JSON message protocols.  These
correspond to the two kinds of actors who may wish to communicate with a
Presence Server: clients (usually Context Servers) providing and subscribing to
presence information, and administrators.  Each of the ports that a Presence
Server listens for connections on can be configured to support either or both
of these protocols.

<p>Each of these protocols is associated with a particular object ref to which
messages should be addressed:

<ul>
<li><code>client</code> for clients providing and seeking presence
information.</li>
<li><code>admin</code> for administrator messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Protocols</h2>

<p>While there are two different message protocols, they share a common set
of messages pertaining to connection housekeeping.  These messages may be
targeted at either of the two protocol objects described above.

<a name="auth"></a><h3>auth</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"auth", auth:<i>?AUTHDESC</i>, label:<i>?STR</i>}
</code></div>

<p>This message begins a new session with the Presence Server, providing
whatever authorization credentials as may be appropriate (according to the
Presence Server's server configuration) to gain access to services.

<p>An <code>auth</code> message <strong>must</strong> be the first message sent
to <code>client</code>, or <code>admin</code> on any new connection to the
Presence Server.  Any other message to these objects will result in immediate
termination of the connection.

<p>If the <code>auth</code> operation fails, the connection will be terminated
by the Presence Server.  Otherwise, the client is thereafter free to send
messages according to the protocol of the <code><i>REF</i></code> that was
authorized.

<ul>
<li><code>auth</code> is a bundle of authorization information, as described
below.  The specific authorization information that is relevant depends on the
configuration of the Presence Server server port being connected to.  If the
<code>auth</code> parameter is omitted, an uncontrolled access in
<em>open</em> mode is assumed.</li>

<li><code>label</code> is an optional label for the connection.  This will be
used in server log entries for debugging purposes and for identifying the
connection in administrative requests.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Authorization information</h4>

<p>The <code>auth</code> parameter of the <code>auth</code> message describes
a bundle of authorization information to authorize access.  Its general form
is:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
    { type:"auth", mode:<i>STR</i>, code:<i>?STR</i>, id:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>mode</code> is the requested authorization mode.  Currently
recognized authorization modes are <code>"open"</code> and
<code>"password"</code>.  Other modes may be relevant in the future or when
talking to other kinds of servers.</li>

<li><code>code</code> is an authorization code, whose meaning varies depending
on the authorization mode.  In the case of open mode, it is irrelevant and
should not be provided.  In the case of password mode, it is a password
string.</li>

<li><code>id</code> is an optional identity string, whose meaning varies
depending on the authorization mode.  In the case of open mode, it is
irrelevant and should not be provided.  In the case of password mode, it may or
may not be relevant depending on the configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>disconnect</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"disconnect" }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the server to terminate its connection to the sender.
The connection to the server is broken.

<h3>ping</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"ping", tag:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message tests connectivity to the server.

<ul>
<li><code>tag</code> is an optional string that may be anything of the client's
choosing.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the message is successfully received by the server, it will reply
with:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"pong", tag:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>
<ul>
<li><code>tag</code> echoes the tag from the <code>ping</code> message, if
there was one, or will be omitted if the original <code>ping</code> also
omitted it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>debug</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"debug", msg:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message delivers debugging information to the server.  If the server is
configured to permit this, the string given in the <code>msg</code> parameter
will be written to the server's log.  If the server is not configured to permit
this, this message will simply be ignored.

<h2>Client Protocol</h2>

<p>The Presence Server client protocol is used by a Context Server in order
both to inform the Presence Server of changes in the status of users hosted by
that Context Server and to request information about the status of users hosted
by other Context Servers.

<h3>user</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"client", op:"user", context:<i>CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>USERREF_STR</i>, on:<i>BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message informs the Presence Server of a user arriving in or departing
from a context hosted by the sender.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context that the user entered or
exited.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the ref of the user who entered or exited.</li>

<li><code>on</code> is a flag that is true the user entered, false if the user
exited.</li>
</ul>

<h3>subscribe</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"client", op:"subscribe", context:<i>STR</i>,
          domains:<i>?</i>[<i>STR</i>], visible:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests a subscription to notifications about changes in
users' presence status.  This subscription is requested on behalf of users in
some context hosted by the requestor.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of a context (hosted by the sender) to
which notifications should be sent when the presence status of "users of
interest" changes.  "Users of interest" are any users in the domain-specific
social graphs of users currently in the named context.</li>

<li><code>domains</code> is an optional array of the names of social graph
domains of interest.  The set of available social graph domains is
application-specific, but might represent abstractions such as friends,
enemies, allies, etc.  If omitted, no notification subscriptions are actuall
generated and this message serves only to update the visibility status of the
named context.</li>

<li><code>visible</code> is an optional boolean flag indicating whether users
in the named context are to be considered visible to users outside the context.
If true, users in the context are considered present.  If false, it is as if
user in the context are not online at all.  If omitted, this flag defaults to
true.</li>
</ul>

For example, the message:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
   { to:"client", op:"subscribe", context:"ctx-foo", domain:["friends"] }
</code></div>

<p>would be a request to be notified about changes in the presence status of
the friends of users in the context <code>ctx-foo</code>.

<p>When a subscription is first created, the Presence Server immediately sends
notification messages to the subscribing Context Server updating it about any
now relevant presence information.  Thereafter, any time a user enters or
leaves a context on one of the constellation of Context Servers connected to
the Presence Server, one or more notifications may be generated announcing this
information to interested parties.  The form of these notifications is
described in detail in the section <a href="#notifications">Notifications</a>
below.

<h3>unsubscribe</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"client", op:"unsubscribe", context:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the Presence Server to cancel a notification
subscription established by an earlier <code>subscribe</code> request.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the context ref of the context that is no longer
interested in receiving presence status updates for its users.  The indicated
context is also then considered to no longer be visible.</li>
</ul>

<a name="notifications"></a><h2>Notifications</h2>

As the presence of users in different contexts on different users changes, the
Presence Server sends notification messages to the various Context Servers
informing them.  There are two different notification messages:

<h3>utog</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"client", op:"utog", user:<i>USER_REF</i>, ctx:<i>CONTEXT_REF</i>,
          on:<i>BOOL</i>, togroup:[<i>DOMAIN_DESC</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>This message, "user to group", informs a group of users about the change in
presence status of a single user.

<ul>
<li><code>user</code> is the user ref of the user whose presence status has
changed.</li>

<li><code>ctx</code> is the contet ref of the context that the indicated user
has entered or left</li>

<li><code>on</code> is a boolean flag that, if true, indicates that the user
entered the context (and is now online), and, if false, indicates that the user
has exited the context (and is now offline).</li>

<li><code>togroup</code> is an array of descriptors that indicates what users
need to be informed of this event.  There is one element in this array for each
relevant social graph domain.</li></ul>

Each domain descriptor takes the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 { domain:<i>STR</i>, who:[<i>CTX_DESC</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>domain</code> is the name of the social graph domain being
described.</li>

<li><code>who</code> is an array of descriptors listing the users, by context,
who should be informed.  There is one entry in this array of each context
containing users to be notified.</li></ul>

Each context descriptor in turn takes the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 { ctx:<i>CONTEXT_REF</i>, users:[<i>USER_REF</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>ctx</code> is the context ref of a context containing users to be
informed.</li>

<li><code>users</code> is an array of user refs of users in the given context
who should be notified.</li>
</ul>

<h3>gtou</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"client", op:"gtou", touser:<i>USER_REF</i>,
          ctx:<i>CONTEXT_REF</i>, group:[<i>DOMAIN_DESC</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>This message, "group to user", informs a user about the presence of a group
of other users.

<ul>
<li><code>touser</code> is the user ref of the user who is being notified.</li>

<li><code>ctx</code> is the context ref of the context in which the user is
being notified (since different contexts may subscribe to different social
graph domains).</li>

<li><code>group</code> is an array of descriptors that indicate which users are
present and where.  There is one element of this array for each relevant social
graph domain.</li>
</ul>

Each domain descriptor takes the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 { domain:<i>STR</i>, friends:[<i>FRIEND_DESC</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>domain</code> is the name of the social graph domain being
described.</li>

<li><code>friends</code> is an array of descriptors listing the presences of
other users.  There is one entry in this array for each user whose presence is
being described.</li></ul>

Each friend descriptor in turn takes the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 { user:<i>USER_REF</i>, ctx:<i>CONTEXT_REF</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>user</code> is the user ref of a user in the social graph of the user
being notified (labelled here a "friend" for descriptive convenience, even
though a given social graph domain can actually encode any sort of
relationship, not just friendship).</li>

<li><code>ctx</code> is the context ref of the context in which the friend is
present.  Note that unlike the <code>utog</code> notification, there is no
online vs. offline presence indicator, as this notification is only ever used
to describe users who are online.</li></ul>.


<h2>Admin Protocol</h2>

<p>The Presence Server admin protocol is used to administer the Presence Server
itself.

<h3>dump</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"dump", depth:<i>INT</i>, user:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the Presence Server to provide a dump of its current
set of known presence information to the requesting administrator.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>depth</code> indicates the depth of detail to provide (see
below).</li>

<li><code>user</code> optionally limits the scope of the information dumped
to presence information concerning the particular named user.</li>
</ul>

The Presence Server will reply  with a message of the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"admin", op:"dump", numusers:<i>INT</i>,
          numpresences:<i>INT</i>,
          users:[<i>USERDUMP</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>numpresences</code> is the total number of active user presenences
currently being tracked by the Presence Server.</li>

<li><code>numusers</code> is the number unique users whose presences are
currently being tracked.</li>

<li><code>users</code> is an array of user dump descriptors, each of
which describes one user.  This will only be provided if the value of the
<code>depth</code> parameter was greater than 0.</li> </ul>

The user dump descriptor takes the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 { user:<i>STR</i>, pres:[<i>STR</i>], conn:[<i>FRIENDSDUMP</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>user</code> is the ref of the user whose presence information is
being described.</li>

<li><code>pres</code> is an array of the refs of the contexts in which the
indicated user is currently present.  This information is only provided if the
<code>depth</code> parameter is greater than 1.</li>

<li><code>conn</code> is is an array of social graph connection information for
the indicated user, with one element for each social graph domain for which
there is at least one user present who is connected to the indicated user by
the graph.  This information is only provided if the <code>depth</code>
parameter is greater than 2.</li>
</ul>

The friends dump descriptor takes the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 { domain:<i>STR</i>, friends:[<i>USERREF_STR</i>] }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>domain</code> is the name of the social graph domain.</li>

<li><code>friends</code> is an array of the refs of other users connected to
the user being dumped via the named social graph, who currently have some
presence.</li>
</ul>

<h3>reinit</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"reinit" }
</code></div>

<p>This message instructs the Presence Server to reinitialize itself.

<h3>shutdown</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"shutdown", kill:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message instructs the Presence Server to shut down.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>kill</code> is an optional flag that if true orders an abrupt
termination.  Normally, a server will empty its message queues, checkpoint any
active state, and perform an orderly shutdown.  However, if the
<code>kill</code> flag is true, it will exit immediately without stopping to
clean things up.  The value defaults to false if the parameter is omitted.</li>
</ul>
