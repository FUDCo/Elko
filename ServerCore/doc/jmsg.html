<h1>JSON Messaging</h1>

<p>Communications between the client and the Context Server, as well as between
the Context Server and various ancillary servers that work in cooperation with
it, is via <em>JSON Messaging</em>.

<p>JSON Messaging is a set of conventions for encoding object-to-object
messages using JSON.  A <em>JSON Message</em> is simply a JSON object of the
form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
    { to:<i>TARGETREF</i>, op:<i>VERB</i>, <i>params...</i> }
</code></div>

<p>The property <code>"to"</code> designates the message target, i.e., the
object to which the message is addressed.  Its value is a <em>Reference
String</em>, or <em>Ref</em> for short, a string that uniquely names the target
object in the scope of the messaging system on the arriving end of the
communication.

<p>The property <code>"op"</code> is the message verb, i.e., the operation code
or method selector, a string that indicates to the message target what
operation is to be performed upon receipt of the message.

<p>Any number of other properties may also be included, and serve as named
parameters.  Their number, names, and meanings vary depending on the specific
message being sent.  They may be of any data type supported by JSON, as long as
it is consistent with the mutual understanding by the sender and receiver of
the proper content for the message.

<p>For example, the message:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
    { to:"user.47.3699102", op:"say", text:"Hello world!" }
</code></div>

<p>might be a chat message directed to another user.

<p>JSON messages may be transmitted over any reasonable communications medium,
as well as possibly some unreasonable ones.  The current implementation
supports TCP and HTTP.  HTTP is used for communication between servers on the
one hand and Javascript client software running in web browsers on the other.
TCP is used for communication among servers, for delivery of server-side
administrative commands under control of dedicated software designed for such
purposes, and for manual testing using a TCP-based text communications utility
such as Telnet.

<p>A message connection is always a bidirectional, multiplexed,
machine-to-machine (or process-to-process) message pipe.  Two communicating
machines, whether they are a client and a server or a server and another
server, typically maintain a single connection between them, over which all
message traffic on behalf of objects on either side is carried.  A given
connection is kept alive for the duration of the interaction between the two
machines, until one side or the other decides to terminate it.  This
communications session is stateful, in that either party is permitted, indeed
expected, to maintain continuity of state between successive messages.  This is
directly in contrast to stateless, sessionless protocols such as HTTP.

<p>Though a connection is bidirectional, messaging over the connection is
unidirectional and asynchronous.  That is, as soon as a running application
passes a message to the messaging system, it is able to continue on its own
without waiting for reply or confirmation.  When a message is part of a
request-reply protocol, the reply must be treated as an explicit message by the
two parties.  Any such protocol is part of the design of the particular
application in question and is not the business of the messaging system itself.
Any given message may result in a reply from its recipient, no reply, or
possibly even many replies, depending on the design of the application and its
protocols.

<p>Messages on a connection are ordered, in the sense that a sequence of
messages transmitted over a given connection from machine A to machine B will
be received at machine B in the same order they were transmitted by machine A.
However, this ordering is strictly on a per-connection basis.  If there is more
than one connection between two machines (not normal but not forbidden either),
there are no guarantees about the relative order of messages sent over
different connections.

<p>Since HTTP is stateless and sessionless, an additional transport protocol is
used when the message transport medium is HTTP.  This protocol uses special
URLs and additional JSON encoding within the HTTP request and reply bodies to
efficiently synthesize a sessionful, symmetric, bidirectional, asynchronous
message channel out of an ongoing series of transient, asymmetric, synchronous,
RPC-style HTTP requests.  The details of this transport protocol are documented
<a href="httpjmsg.html">here</a>.
