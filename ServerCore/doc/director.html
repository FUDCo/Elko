<h1>The Elko Director Protocols</h1>

<h2>The Director</h2>

<p>The <em>Director</em> is an Elko server that coordinates the
operation of a collection of Context Servers.  In particular, the Context
Servers that a Director is working for keep it informed of their relative load
factors, the opening and closing of contexts, the coming and going of users,
and their availability for providing context services to arriving users.

<p>The Director acts as a first contact point for users seeking entry to a
particular context.  Rather than contacting a Context Server directly, a user
client instead contacts a Director (indeed, the client may not even know the
network address of any Context Server).  The client seeking entry informs the
director of the ref of the context they wish to enter and the ref of the user
as whom they wish to enter.  The Director then checks to see if the requested
context is already loaded on one of the Context Servers it knows about.  If it
is, the Director directs the user client to that Context Server.  If it is not,
the Director picks a suitable Context Server and requests it to open the
desired context, and directs the user client to to this newly chosen Context
Server.  In either case, when the Director directs a client to a Context
Server, it does not merely give the client the address of the Context Server,
but also provides a <em>reservation</em>, an unguessable token that the
Director also forwards to the chosen Context Server along with the context ref
of the context being entered and the user ref of the user.  When the client
contacts the Context Server, it provides this reservation token along with its
other entry credentials.  The Context Server only permits a given client to
enter a given context if it also provides the appropriate reservation token to
do so.  Reservations also expire after a short time (currently 30 seconds).
This scheme allows the Director to act as a load balancer for a server farm
full of Context Servers.

<p>Since a Director keeps track of the active users on its collection of
Context Servers, it can also enable users to rendezvous with each other, by
directing a user to the appropriate context containing another user whom they
wish to meet.  This is especially important in highly scalable contexts, since
context cloning may result in more than one instance of a particular context
being active at any given time.  The Director keeps track of which users are in
which clone instances.  In a similar vein, the Director can act as a message
relay between users and contexts on different Context Servers.

<p>Finally, since a Director is in contact with the entire collection of
Context Servers, it can act as a centralized administration contact point for
the server farm, enabling the whole farm or selected servers to be
reinitialized, shutdown, or directed to take other specific actions.

<p>A Director understands three different JSON message protocols.  These
correspond to the three kinds of actors who may wish to communicate with a
Director: Context Servers providing context services, clients seeking
reservations for entry into contexts, and administrators.  Each of the ports
that a Director listens for connections on can be configured to support any or
all of these protocols.

<p>Each of these protocols is associated with a particular object ref to which
messages should be addressed:

<ul>
<li><code>director</code> for client messages requesting direction to Context
Servers.</li>
<li><code>provider</code> for Context Servers providing services.</li>
<li><code>admin</code> for administrator messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Protocols</h2>

<p>While there are three different message protocols, they share a common set
of messages pertaining to connection housekeeping.  These messages may be
targeted at any of the three protocol objects described above.

<a name="auth"></a><h3>auth</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"auth", auth:<i>?AUTHDESC</i>, label:<i>?STR</i>}
</code></div>

<p>This message begins a new session with the Director, providing whatever
authorization credentials as may be appropriate (according to the Director's
server configuration) to gain access to services.

<p>An <code>auth</code> message <strong>must</strong> be the first message sent
to <code>director</code>, <code>provider</code>, or <code>admin</code> on any
new connection to the Director.  Any other message to these objects will result
in immediate termination of the connection.

<p>If the <code>auth</code> operation fails, the connection will be terminated
by the Director.  Otherwise, the client is thereafter free to send messages
according to the protocol of the <code><i>REF</i></code> that was authorized.

<ul>
<li><code>auth</code> is a bundle of authorization information, as described
below.  The specific authorization information that is relevant depends on the
configuration of the Director server port being connected to.  If the
<code>auth</code> parameter is omitted, an uncontrolled access in
<em>open</em> mode is assumed.</li>

<li><code>label</code> is an optional label for the connection.  This will be
used in server log entries for debugging purposes and for identifying the
connection in administrative requests.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Authorization information</h4>

<p>The <code>auth</code> parameter of the <code>auth</code> message describes
a bundle of authorization information to authorize access.  Its general form
is:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
    { type:"auth", mode:<i>STR</i>, code:<i>?STR</i>, id:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>mode</code> is the requested authorization mode.  Currently
recognized authorization modes are <code>"open"</code> and
<code>"password"</code>.  Other modes may be relevant in the future or when
talking to other kinds of servers.</li>

<li><code>code</code> is an authorization code, whose meaning varies depending
on the authorization mode.  In the case of open mode, it is irrelevant and
should not be provided.  In the case of password mode, it is a password
string.</li>

<li><code>id</code> is an optional identity string, whose meaning varies
depending on the authorization mode.  In the case of open mode, it is
irrelevant and should not be provided.  In the case of password mode, it may or
may not be relevant depending on the configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>disconnect</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"disconnect" }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the server to terminate its connection to the sender.
The connection to the server is broken.

<h3>ping</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"ping", tag:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message tests connectivity to the server.

<ul>
<li><code>tag</code> is an optional string that may be anything of the client's
choosing.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the message is successfully received by the server, it will reply
with:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"pong", tag:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>
<ul>
<li><code>tag</code> echoes the tag from the <code>ping</code> message, if
there was one, or will be omitted if the original <code>ping</code> also
omitted it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>debug</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:<i>REF</i>, op:"debug", msg:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message delivers debugging information to the server.  If the server is
configured to permit this, the string given in the <code>msg</code> parameter
will be written to the server's log.  If the server is not configured to permit
this, this message will simply be ignored.

<h2>User Protocol</h2>

<p>The Director user protocol is used by user clients requesting reservations
for entry to contexts.  There is only one message beyond the basic protocol:

<h3>reserve</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"director", op:"reserve", protocol:<i>STR</i>,
          context:<i>CONTEXTREF_STR</i>, user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests a reservation for entry into a context.

<ul>
<li><code>protocol</code> is the communications protocol by which the requestor
wishes to communicate with the Context Server into which the requested context
will be loaded.  Valid values currently are <code>"http"</code>,
<code>"tcp"</code>, or <code>"rtcp"</code>.</li>

<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context into which entry is
sought.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the optional ref of the user who is seeking entry.  If
omitted, the reservation being requested will be anonymous.</li>
</ul>

If the reservation is successful, the reply will take the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"director", op:"reserve", context:<i>CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>, hostport:<i>STR</i>,
          reservation:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context, which will match the
corresponding parameter from the request.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the ref of the user, which will match the
corresponding parameter from the request (and will be omitted if it was omitted
from the request).</li>

<li><code>hostport</code> is a string of the form
<code>"<em>hostname</em>:<em>portnumber</em>"</code> indicating the host name
and port number of the Context Server on which the reservation has been
made.</li>

<li><code>reservation</code> is the reservation token to present to the Context
Server in the <code>entercontext</code> request to enter the context.</li>
</ul>

If the reservation fails, the reply will take the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"director", op:"reserve", context:<i>CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>, deny:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> and <code>user</code> have the same meanings as in the
success case.</li>

<li><code>deny</code> is an error message string indicating why the
reservation could not be made.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Provider Protocol</h2>

<p>The Director provider protocol is used by providers of context services,
that is, by Context Servers, to aprise the Director of their availability.

<h3>address</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"provider", op:"address", protocol:<i>STR</i>,
          hostport:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message informs the Director of the sender's availability to speak some
protocol at some network address.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>protocol</code> is a communications protocol that the sender speaks
at the indicated address.  Valid values currently are <code>"tcp"</code>,
<code>"http"</code>, and <code>"rtcp"</code>.

<li><code>hostport</code> is a string of the form
<code>"<em>hostname</em>:<em>portnumber</em>"</code> indicating the host name
and port number at which the sender may be contacted using the indicated
protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h3>context</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"provider", op:"context", context:<i>CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          open:<i>BOOL</i>, yours:<i>BOOL</i>, maxcap:<i>?INT</i>,
          basecap:<i>?INT</i>, restricted:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message informs the Director of the opening or closing of a context by
the sending Context Server.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context that was opened or closed.

<li><code>open</code> is a flag that is true if the context was opened, false
if it was closed.</li>

<li><code>yours</code> is a flag that is true if this context was opened at the
request of the Director to whom this message is being sent.  This is used in a
handshake to resolve a race condition that can happen if multiple different
Directors concurrently request different Context Servers to open the same
context.  Note that this flag always indicates whether the recipient requested
the <em>opening</em> of the context, regardless of whether this message is
describing a context open or a context close.</li>

<li><code>maxcap</code> indicates the maximum number of users that the Director
should allow to be admitted to the context.  This is only relevant on a context
open.  It is optional, and defaults to -1, meaning unlimited capacity, if
omitted.

<li><code>basecap</code> indicates the maximum number of users that the
Director should place in the context before directing a clone of the context to
be opened instead.  This is only relevant on a context open, and defaults to
the value of <code>maxcap</code> if omitted.  A value of -1 indicates that the
context should never be cloned.</li>

<li><code>restricted</code> is a flag that is true if the context is
restricted.  A restricted context is one that users (clients authorized to send
messages to <code>"user"</code> may not request a reservation for (though
context servers themselves may).</li> This is only relevant on a context open.
It is optional and defaults to false, meaning unrestricted, if omitted.  </ul>

<h3>load</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"provider", op:"load", factor:<i>FLOAT</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message informs the Director of sender's current load.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>factor</code> is sender's current load factor.  This may be any
value, though all Context Servers talking to a given Director should all share
a single, commensurable metric.</li>
</ul>

<h3>relay</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"provider", op:"relay", context:<i>?CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>, msg:<i>JSONOBJ</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the Director to relay a message to a user or context
on a different Context Server from the sender.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context to relay the message
to.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the ref of the user to relay the message to.</li>

<li><code>msg</code> is the message to relay.</li>
</ul>

The <code>context</code> and <code>user</code> parameters are mutually
exclusive, and one or the other must be provided.  If the base ref of a cloned
context or user is specified, the message will be relayed to all Context
Servers (other than the sender) who host clones of the indicated recipient
context or user.

<p>The <code>relay</code> message will result in the corresponding
<code>relay</code> message being sent to all relevant Context Servers (i.e.,
those serving the context or user indicated).  It takes the same form as the
inbound request:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"provider", op:"relay", context:<i>?CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>, msg:<i>JSONOBJ</i> }
</code></div>

<h3>user</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"provider", op:"user", context:<i>CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>USERREF_STR</i>, on:<i>BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message informs the Director of the entry or exit of a user to or from
a context hosted by the sender.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context that the user entered or
exited.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the ref of the user who entered or exited.</li>

<li><code>on</code> is a flag that is true the user entered, false if the user
exited.</li>
</ul>

<h3>willserve</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"provider", op:"willserve", context:<i>STR</i>,
          capacity:<i>?INT</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message informs the Director of the sender's availability to serve some
family of contexts.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref prefix of the family of contexts that the
sender is prepared to serve.  Typically this is the string
<code>"context"</code>, but that is not mandatory.</li>

<li><code>capacity</code> is an optional limit on the maximum number of user
clients that the sender is willing to serve for the indicated class of
contexts.  If omitted, it defaults to -1, indicating no limit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>close</h3>

This message may be sent by the Director to the Context Server.  It instructs
the Context Server to force the closure of a context or the disconnection of a
user.<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"provider", op:"close", context:<i>?CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>, dup:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context to close.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the ref of the user to disconnect.</li>

<li><code>dup</code> is true if the context closure or user disconnection is
requested as part of the Director resolving a duplicated context open.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>context</code> and <code>user</code> parameters are mutually
exclusive.

<h3>reinit</h3>

This message may be sent by the Director to the Context Server.  It instructs
the Context Server to reinitialize itself.<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"provider", op:"reinit" }
</code></div>

<h3>shutdown</h3>

This message may be sent by the Director to the Context Server. It instructs
the Context Server to shut itself down.<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"provider", op:"shutdown", kill:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>kill</code> is an optional flag that if true orders an abrupt
termination of the Context Server.  Normally, the server would empty its
message queue, checkpoint any active state, and perform an orderly shutdown.
However, if the <code>kill</code> flag is true, it will exit immediately
without stopping to clean things up.  The value defaults to false if the
parameter is omitted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>say</h3>

This message may be sent by the Director to the Context Server. It requests the
Context Server to deliver a <code>say</code> message to a particular user or to
the users in a particular context.<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"provider", op:"say", context:<i>?CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>, text:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of a context being spoken to.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the ref of a user being spoken to.</li>

<li><code>text</code> is speech text directed at the indicated context or
user.</li>
</ul>

The <code>context</code> and <code>user</code> parameters are mutually
exclusive, and one or the other must be provided.  If the base ref of a cloned
context or user is specified, all clones of the indicated context or user will
be spoken to.


<h2>Admin Protocol</h2>

<p>The Director admin protocol is used to administer the Director and,
indirectly, the entire collection of Context Servers it is in contact with.

<h3>close</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"close", context:<i>?CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message instructs the Director to force the closure of a context or the
disconnection of a user.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context to close.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the ref of the user to disconnect.</li>
</ul>

The <code>context</code> and <code>user</code> parameters are mutually
exclusive, and one or the other must be provided.  If the base ref of a cloned
context or user is specified, all clones of the indicated context or user will
be closed.

<p>If the indicated context is open or the indicated user is connected, the
Director will send a provider <code>close</code> message to each relevant
connected Context Server instructing it to take the requested action.

<h3>dump</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"dump", depth:<i>INT</i>, provider:<i>?STR</i>,
          context:<i>?CONTEXTREF_STR</i> }
</code></div>

requesting administrator.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>depth</code> indicates the depth of detail to provide (see
below).</li>

<li><code>provider</code> optionally limits the scope of the information dumped
to providers matching the parameter string.  This is matched against the label
string provided in the <code>auth</code> message that providers sent when they
connected to the Director.</li>

<li><code>context</code> optionally limits the scope of the information dumped
to contexts matching the parameter string.</li>
</ul>

The Director will reply  with a message of the form:<p>

</code></div>

<p>This message instructs the Director to reinitialize one or more servers.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>provider</code> is the optional label for a provider to be
reinitialized.  Alternatively, the string <code>"all"</code> indicates that all
providers are to be reinitialized.  If omitted, no providers will be

          user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>, msg:<i>JSONOBJ</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the Director to relay a message to a user or context
on whatever Context Server is appropriate.  It takes the exact same form and
has the same behavior as the corresponding message in the provider protocol,
except of course that it is targeted at <code>"admin"</code> instead of
<code>"provider"</code>.

<h3>say</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"say", context:<i>?CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i>, text:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the Director to deliver a <code>say</code> message to
a particular user or to the users in a particular context.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of a context being spoken to.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the ref of a user being spoken to.</li>

<li><code>text</code> is speech text directed at the indicated context or
user.</li>
</ul>

The <code>context</code> and <code>user</code> parameters are mutually
exclusive, and one or the other must be provided.  If the base ref of a cloned
context or user is specified, all clones of the indicated context or user will
be spoken to.

<p>The Director will send a corresponding <code>say</code> message to each
relevant Context Server.

<h3>shutdown</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"shutdown", provider:<i>?STR</i>,
          director:<i>?BOOL</i>, kill:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message instructs the Director to shut down one or more servers.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>provider</code> is the optional label for a provider to be shut down.
Alternatively, the string <code>"all"</code> indicates that all providers are
to be shut down.  If omitted, no providers will be shut down.</li>

<li><code>director</code> is an optional flag that if true directs that the
Director itself also be shut down.  The value defaults to false if the
parameter is omitted.  Director shutdown, if requested, will take place after
any provider shutdowns.</li>

<li><code>kill</code> is an optional flag that if true orders an abrupt
termination of the indicated server(s).  Normally, servers will empty their
message queues, checkpoint any active state, and perform an orderly shutdown.
However, if the <code>kill</code> flag is true, they will exit immediately
without stopping to clean things up.  The value defaults to false if the
parameter is omitted.</li>
</ul>

If any providers are to be shut down, each will be sent a corresponding
<code>shutdown</code> message on its provider connection.

<h3>watch</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"watch", context:<i>?CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the Director to begin providing ongoing updates as to
the location of a context or user.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context of interest.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the ref of the user of interest.</li>
</ul>

The <code>context</code> and <code>user</code> parameters are mutually
exclusive, and one or the other must be provided.  If the base ref of a cloned
context or user is specified, the locations of all clones of the indicated
context or user will be watched.

<p>The operation of <code>watch</code> is similar to <code>find</code>, except
that the Director maintains continuous surveillance of the context or user
indicated.  Each time the context is opened or close, or the user enters or
exits, a <code>context</code> or <code>user</code> message will be sent to the
administrator.  These messages take the same form as they do in the replies to
the <code>find</code> request; the only difference is that the behavior is
spontaneous and asynchronous.

<h3>unwatch</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"unwatch", context:<i>?CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          user:<i>?USERREF_STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests the Director to cease providing ongoing updates as to
the location of a context or user.  It undoes the effect of an earlier
<code>watch</code> request.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context of interest.</li>

<li><code>user</code> is the ref of the user of interest.</li>
</ul>

The <code>context</code> and <code>user</code> parameters are mutually
exclusive, and one or the other must be provided.  For this request to be
useful, the parameters should match those of an earlier <code>watch</code>
request.  However, requesting an <code>unwatch</code> of a context or user that
was not actually being watched is a benign operation with no effect.
