<h1>The Elko Gatekeeper Protocols</h1>

<h2>The Gatekeeper</h2>

<p>The <em>Gatekeeper</em> is an Elko server that provides login reservation
and authentication services for other Elko servers such as the Director.  If
you wish to use user accounts or some other authentication or access control
abstraction to regulate access to a collection of Elko servers, you typically
place a Gatekeeper between a user and a Director rather than having the user
communicate with the Director directly.

<p>A Gatekeeper understands two different JSON message protocols.  These
correspond to the two kinds of actors who may wish to communicate with a
Gatekeeper: users seeking to login or manage their accounts, and
administrators.  Each of the ports that a Gatekeeper listens for connections on
can be configured to support either or both of these protocols.

<p>Each of these protocols is associated with a particular object ref to which
messages should be addressed:

<ul>
<li><code>gatekeeper</code> for user messages requesting access.</li>
<li><code>admin</code> for administrator messages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that since a Gatekeeper makes its own outbound connection to a Director
per its configuration, it also speaks the <code>director</code> protocol
However, the Gatekeeper speaks the client side of this protocol; you cannot
yourself establish a connection to a Gatekeeper port that uses this protocol.

<h2>User Protocol</h2>

<p>The Gatekeeper user protocol is used by clients who wish to make an
authenticated entry into a context.

<h3>reserve</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"gatekeeper", op:"reserve", protocol:<i>STR</i>,
          context:<i>CONTEXTREF_STR</i>, id:<i>?STR</i>, name:<i>?STR</i>,
          password:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests a reservation for entry into a context.

<ul>
<li><code>protocol</code> is the communications protocol by which the
requestor wishes to communicate with the Context Server into which the
requested context will be loaded.  Valid values currently
are <code>"http"</code> or
<code>"tcp"</code>.</li>

<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context into which entry is
sought.</li>

<li><code>id</code> is an identifier for the entity who is seeking entry.  This
is interpreted in the scope of whatever authentication regime the Gatekeeper is
configured to be using.  It may be omitted if the context in question does not
support a user abstraction or if it supports anonymous users.</li>

<li><code>name</code> is an optional displayable name string for the user who
is seeking entry.  If omitted, it will be empty.</li>

<li><code>password</code> is the password (or similar authentication string) to
authenticate the access of the indicated user, as is appropriate for whatever
authentication regime the Gatekeeper is configured to be using.
</ul>

If the reservation is successful, the reply will take the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"gatekeeper", op:"reserve", context:<i>CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          id:<i>?STR</i>, actor:<i>?STR</i>, name:<i>?STR</i>,
          auth:<i>?STR</i>, hostport:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> is the ref of the context, which will match the
corresponding parameter from the request.</li>

<li><code>id</code> is an identifier for the entity that sought entry, which
will match the corresponding parameter from the request (and will be omitted if
it was omitted from the request).</li>

<li><code>actor</code> is an object ref for the object representing the user in
the context, which may be omitted if this is not a relevant abstraction for the
context in question.</li>

<li><code>name</code> is a displayable string labelling the user in the
context, if relevant.</li>

<li><code>auth</code> is the authorization code (typically a reservation token)
to present to the Context Server in the <code>entercontext</code> request to
enter the context.</li>

<li><code>hostport</code> is a string of the form
<code>"<em>hostname</em>:<em>portnumber</em>"</code> indicating the host name
and port number of the Context Server on which the reservation has been
made.</li>
</ul>

If the reservation fails, the reply will take the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"gatekeeper", op:"reserve", context:<i>CONTEXTREF_STR</i>,
          id:<i>?STR</i>, deny:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>context</code> and <code>id</code> have the same meanings as in the
success case.</li>

<li><code>deny</code> is an error message string indicating why the
reservation could not be made.</li>
</ul>

<h3>setpassword</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
&rarr; { to:"gatekeeper", op:"setpassword", id:<i>STR</i>,
         oldpassword:<i>?STR</i>, newpassword:<i>?STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message makes a request to the Gatekeeper to change a user's password.

<p>where:

<ul>

<li><code>id</code> is an identifier for the user seeking to change tneir
password.  This is interpreted in the scope of whatever authentication regime
the Gatekeeper is configured to be using.</li>

<li><code>oldpassword</code> is the password (or similar authentication string)
to authenticate the access of the indicated user, as is appropriate for
whatever authentication regime the Gatekeeper is configured to be using.</li>

<li><code>newpassword</code> is the new password string for the user.
to authenticate the access of the indicated user, as is appropriate for
whatever authentication regime the Gatekeeper is configured to be using.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Admin Protocol</h2>

<p>The Gatekeeper admin protocol is used to administer the Gatekeeper server.

<h3>director</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
&rarr; { to:"admin", op:"director", hostport:<i>?STR</i>,
         auth:<i>?AUTHDESC</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message requests that the Director this Gatekeeper is talking to to be
changed or reported.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>hostport</code> is a string of the form
<code>"<em>hostname</em>:<em>portnumber</em>"</code> indicating the host name
and port number of the Director that the Gatekeeper should now use.  If
omitted, the request merely asks that the Director be reported in the reply
without being changed.</li>

<li><code>auth</code> is an optional bundle of authorization information for
the Gatekeeper to use in establishing its connection to the Director.  This
is exactly the authorization descriptor documented in the description of the
<a href="director.html#auth">Director's <code>auth</code> message</a>.
</li>
</ul>

The Gatekeeper will normally reply with a message of the form:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"gatekeeper", op:"director", hostport:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>hostport</code> is a string of the form
<code>"<em>hostname</em>:<em>portnumber</em>"</code> indicating the host name
and port number of the Director that the Gatekeeper is using.</li>
</ul>

In the event of a failure to update the Director setting, the Gatekeeper will
reply with:<p>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &larr; { to:"gatekeeper", op:"director", failure:<i>STR</i> }
</code></div>

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>failure</code> is an error message string attempting to describe what
went wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h3>reinit</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"reinit" }
</code></div>

<p>This message instructs the Gatekeeper to reinitialize itself.

<h3>shutdown</h3>

<div class="indent"><code>
 &rarr; { to:"admin", op:"shutdown" kill:<i>?BOOL</i> }
</code></div>

<p>This message instructs the Gatekeeper to shut itself down.

<p>where:

<ul>
<li><code>kill</code> is an optional flag that if true orders an abrupt
termination of the server.  Normally, a server will empty its message queues,
checkpoint any active state, and perform an orderly shutdown.  However, if
the <code>kill</code> flag is true, it will exit immediately without stopping
to clean things up.  The value defaults to false if the parameter is
omitted.</li>
</ul>
