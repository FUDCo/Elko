<h1>The Context-User-Item Object Model</h1>

<p>The Elko Context Server supports applications build around the
Context-User-Item object model.

<p>A <em>Context</em> is a rendezvous and coordination point for communications
among multiple parties.  A context is hosted on a <em>Context Server</em>.
Within a context may be found users and items.

<p>A <em>User</em> represents a human being sitting at a client application,
typically implemented as Javascript code in a web browser.  At any given time,
a user is in some context.  Multiple users may be in the same context together,
enabling them to engage in multiparty interactions of various kinds.

<p>An <em>Item</em> is an object that embodies some aspect of the application.
An item is always in some <em>container</em>, which may be a context, a user,
or another item.

<p>Contexts, users and items are all examples of <em>unums</em>, world objects
in a distributed instantiation object pattern.  Each of these objects has a
representation, called a <em>presence</em>, that exists in the Context Server
and in each of the clients.  Each unum has a <em>reference string</em> (or
<em>ref</em> for short) by which it may be named in JSON messages.  When a
client sends a message over a connection to a server and the server receives
it, the message is delivered to the server presence of the object named by the
message as its target.  Similarly, a server may send a message over a
connection to a client, addressing the message to the client presence of some
object.  Additionally, code running in the server may send a single message to
all client presences of some object; the server message system will fan out
that message to all the clients that hold presences of that object, using those
clients' respective connections.  This will be explained in more detail in the
section on server programming below.

<p>Additional objects may exist only on the server or on some particular
client.  These objects may be addressed as the targets of messages
individually.  For example, when a client first connects to the server, the
only server object that is immediately in scope for that client is the
communications session itself, which may be addressed as
<code>"session"</code>.  In particular, the client may send a message to the
session object requesting that the client's associated user be granted
admission to some particular context.

<p>Most of the logic that is specific to particular applications is embodied in
objects known as <em>Mods</em> (short, variously, for "module" or
"modification", depending on your perspective).  A mod is simply a bundle of
behavior and state that is attached to some particular context, user, or item.
The mod augments the object to which it is attached with additional message
protocols specific to whatever functionality it is that the mod provides.  Mods
are most frequently attached to items, since the main thing that distiguishes
one item from another (aside from its identity) is what mods it has that
customize its behavior.
