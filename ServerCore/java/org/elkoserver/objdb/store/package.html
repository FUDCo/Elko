Classes for implementing various Elko object store types.  The various
interfaces and classes define a generic interface to a basic object oriented
database for the persistent storage of the objects used by a Elko server.  By
implementing the {@link org.elkoserver.objdb.store.ObjectStore} interface,
developers can arrange to store objects in arbitrary media of their choosing,
rather than being limited to the particular storage mechanisms that are built
in.
