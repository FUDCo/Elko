<h1>Documentation Index</h1>

<p>The Elko server framework supports real-time stateful multiuser
networked applications, such as multiplayer games, real-time auctions, or
online messaging, all built around the Context-User-Item object model.  This
page is a guide to the available documentation.

already provided as part of the toolkit we distribute.  This document describes
these in detail.</td>
