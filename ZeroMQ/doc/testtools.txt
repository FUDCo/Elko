Testing ZMQ Support

There are two simple command line apps included in the elkozmq.jar
bundle, ZMQSender and ZMQReceiver, that respectively act as sources and sinks
of ZMQ messages.

ZMQReceiver receives messages over a ZMQ socket and prints them to stdout.

Usage:

   java org.elkoserver.foundation.net.zmq.test.ZMQReceiver <ADDRESS>

where <ADDRESS> is the address to listen for ZQM messages on.  Addresses are
expressed in the form:

    [<MODE>:]<HOST>:<PORT>

Where:

   <MODE> indicates the desired ZMQ connection mode.  The two available options
are PULL and SUB, with PULL as the default if the mode is left unspecified.

   <HOST> is the host name associated with the connection (the bind address in
   the case of PULL, the publisher to connect to in the case of SUB).

   <PORT> is the port number of the connection.

For example: SUB:foo.bar.com:5555 would subscribe to messages published by
foo.bar.com on port 5555.


ZMQSender reads JSON messages fed to stdin and sends them to a ZMQ socket.

Usage:

   java org.elkoserver.foundation.net.zmq.test.ZMQSender <ADDRESS>

where <ADDRESS> is the address to feed ZQM messages to.  Addresses are
expressed in the form:

    [<MODE>:]<HOST>:<PORT>

Where:

   <MODE> indicates the desired ZMQ connection mode.  The two available options
are PUSH and PUB, with PUB as the default if the mode is left unspecified.

   <HOST> is the host name associated with the connection (the bind address in
   the case of PUB, the puller to connect to in the case of PUSH).

   <PORT> is the port number of the connection.

For example: PUSH:foo.bar.com:5555 would deliver messages to the puller at
foo.bar.com on port 5555.


These two can be used together, running each in its own terminal window, to set
up a PUB/SUB pair or a PUSH/PULL pair to verify that ZMQ is working on your
machine.
